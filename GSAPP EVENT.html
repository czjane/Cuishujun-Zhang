        <strong>Graphics Project</strong>is an annual series of lectures, discussions, and portfolio reviews exploring the role of graphic design within the field of architecture organized by <strong>Yoonjai Choi.</strong></p>
    <p>We examine various methods of visual communication used to convey concepts to both specialist and general audiences. These events aim to help students build a successful graduation portfolio while simultaneously unpacking the topics, tools, and trends of contemporary graphic design. Past workshop recordings and additional resources are available on the<a href="https://www.arch.columbia.edu/graphics-project">Graphics Project Webpage</a>.</p>

        <em>Graphics Project Workshops</em> are open to all current GSAPP Students. Both lectures on this date will occur in the same meeting.<br>
